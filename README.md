# docs.vanillaframework.io (legacy)

The current documentation site for Vanilla Framework.

This project will soon be discontinued (hopefully by April 2017), as docs.vanillaframework.io will be hosted by [the docs.ubuntu.com application](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/docs.ubuntu.com).

## Running locally

To run this site:

``` bash
curl https://getcaddy.com/ | bash  # Install caddy server if you don't have it
./build-html  # Build HTML documentation from the vanilla-framework repository
caddy  # Run the server
```

Now browse to <http://127.0.0.1:8543/en/> to view the documentation.
